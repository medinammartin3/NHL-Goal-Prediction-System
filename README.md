A full-stack Machine Learning application that streams live NHL game data, processes events in real-time, and calculates the **Expected Goals (xG)** probability for every shot. The system is containerized using Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete ML pipeline for hockey analytics. It connects to the **NHL public API** to fetch live play-by-play data, engineers features on the fly (such as shot distance, angle, speed, and rebound status), and queries a serving API to get predictions from a tuned **XGBoost** model.

The goal is to provide real-time insights into game momentum and shot quality that go beyond basic box scores.

The system currently operates using the best-performing **XGBoost** model.

## System Architecture 

The application consists of two decoupled microservices:

1.  **Streamlit Frontend (`/streamlit`):**
    * User interface for selecting games and visualizing data.
    * Handles the game logic loop (fetching schedule, pinging events).
    * Displays Shot Maps (Plotly) and xG Evolution charts.
2.  **Flask Serving API (`/serving`):**
    * Loads the trained model artifact from **Weights & Biases (WandB)**.
    * Exposes a REST API (`/predict`, `/download_registry_model`) to serve predictions.
    * Handles feature alignment and validation.

**Data Flow:**
`NHL API` → `Game Client (ETL)` → `Flask API (Inference)` → `Streamlit (Visualization)`

### Features
* **Schedule Explorer:** Select any date and pick specific matchups (e.g., *Canadiens vs. Bruins*).
* **Real-Time Simulation:** "Ping" the game to load events in batches, simulating a live feed.
* **Interactive Visualizations:**
    * **Shot Map:** Rink overlay showing shot locations, sized by goal probability.
    * **xG Evolution:** Cumulative xG line chart to track team dominance over time.
* **Advanced Metrics:** Displays calculated features (Distance, Angle, Speed, Rebound) alongside the raw event data.
* **Auto-Model Loading:** Automatically pulls the latest production-ready XGBoost model from the registry.
